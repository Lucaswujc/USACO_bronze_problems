/**
 * Stuck in a Rut [ Memory: 256 MB, CPU: 2 sec ]
 * 
 * Farmer John has recently expanded the size of his farm, so from the perspective of his COWs it is
 * effectively now infinite in size! The COWs think of the grazing area of the farm as an infinite
 * 2D grid of square "cells", each filled with delicious grass (think of each cell as a square in an
 * infinite chessboard). Each of Farmer John's ùëÅ COWs (1‚â§ùëÅ‚â§50 ) starts out in a different cell;
 * some start facing north, and some start facing east.
 * 
 * Every hour, every COW either
 * 
 * Stops if the grass in her current cell was already eaten by another COW. Eats all the grass in
 * her current cell and moves one cell forward according to the direction she faces. Over time, each
 * COW therefore leaves a barren "rut" of empty cells behind her.
 * 
 * If two COWs move onto the same grassy cell in the same move, they share the cell and continue
 * moving in their respective directions in the next hour.
 * 
 * Please determine the amount of grass eaten by each COW. Some COWs never stop, and therefore eat
 * an infinite amount of grass.
 * 
 * INPUT FORMAT:
 * 
 * The first line of input contains ùëÅ . Each of the next ùëÅ lines describes the starting location
 * of a COW, in terms of a character that is either N (for north-facing) or E (for east-facing) and
 * two nonnegative integers ùë• and ùë¶ (0‚â§ùë•‚â§109 , 0‚â§ùë¶‚â§109 ) giving the coordinates of a cell. All
 * ùë• -coordinates are distinct from each-other, and similarly for the ùë¶ -coordinates. To be as
 * clear as possible regarding directions and coordinates, if a COW is in cell (ùë•,ùë¶) and moves
 * north, she ends up in cell (ùë•,ùë¶+1) . If she instead had moved east, she would end up in cell
 * (ùë•+1,ùë¶) .
 * 
 * OUTPUT FORMAT:
 * 
 * Print ùëÅ lines of output. Line ùëñ in the output should describe the number of cells worth of
 * grass that the ùëñ th COW in the input eats. If a COW eats an infinite amount of grass, output
 * "Infinity" for that COW. SAMPLE INPUT:
 * 
 * 6 
 * E 3 5 
 * N 5 3 
 * E 4 6 
 * E 10 4 
 * N 11 2 
 * N 8 1 
 * 
 * SAMPLE OUTPUT:
 * 
 * 5 
 * 3 
 * Infinity 
 * Infinity 
 * 2 
 * 5 
 * 
 * SCORING:
 * 
 * In test cases 2-5, all coordinates are at most 100 . In test cases 6-10, there are no additional
 * constraints.
